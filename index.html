						The anime will center on two girls who enter the world of competitive motorcycle sidecar racing. The show is set on Miyake
						Island, a small and sparsely populated island south of Tokyo, but still lies within the boundaries of the Tokyo Metropolis.
						The main characters are Yuri Miyata and Megumi Meguro. Yuri is the girlish, cool-headed, and slender driver who works
						the accelerator and brake, and whose household runs a guesthouse. Megumi is the boyish, impulsive, and glamorous passenger
						who uses acrobatic skills and body weight to handle the corner work, and whose household runs an inn. Both are students
						at the Tokyo Metropolitan Miyake Girls High School. While they are the complete opposites of each other, and often
						butt heads, they compliment each other well during races. The team will fight other motorcycle sidecar teams from all
						over Japan, each with their own opposing traits, such as honor student and working student, sadist and masochist, and
						a funny man and straight man.
